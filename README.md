## Inspiration
We wanted to create an app that could provide access to accurate and timely information on ongoing wars across the world.
With information provided by Vigilant, individuals can take steps to be keep themselves safe.
Our app can help save lives by predicting the future movement of reported groups.

## What it does

Vigilant allows civilians to report military sightings and provide other users information of military movements and unsafe areas. It provides real time summaries and trends so civilians can keep an eye on warfront developments. The app has authentication checks in place to limit spam and false reports, and uses algorithms to ensure accuracy of data and predict future movements.

## How we built it

We started off by scoping out our web app on Google Docs and broke our project down to simpler issues on Trello. We figured out our database schemas for Mongodb. Our webpages were designed using Figma to visualize in detail how our webpages were supposed to look. Express was used in the backend to hook up our database with our application and React was used for the frontend. We did our data analytics and predictions in Python and hooked it up with our app by building out a Flask api for it. Our authorization uses Auth0 and we hosted our application using docker.

## Challenges we ran into

Designing and coding the frontend as well as trying to run a python script through our express backend. Our main challenges was just being able to get the sheer amount of work done in a timely manner.
